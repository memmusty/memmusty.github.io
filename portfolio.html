                                    <h4>Operationalizing trustworthy AI in Industry (2021)</h4>
                                    <p class="mb-0 text-black-50 text-lg-left">
                                        As a Master's student at the 3AInstitute, I interned at Castlepoint Systems as an AI Ethics Intern where I was tasked to help develop a Trustworthy AI 
                                        framework for the scaling of Castlepoint Systems globally. To develop the trustworthy AI framework, I conducted a system analysis, and then, prototyped 
                                        some of the system analysis results for validation and feedback. The system analysis involved of an analysis of Castlepoint’s culture, policies, and work 
                                        practices. I surveyed published trustworthy AI and ethical AI frameworks using document analysis, conducted interviews, and ethnographic research at Castlepoint. 
                                        I also did a case study on the implications of AI systems usage at scale, and then, conducted Castlepoint Systems stakeholder analysis and values elicitation by 
                                        organizing a judgment call workshop with Castlepoint employees using a Value Sensitive Design approach. As analysis outputs, I proposed an ethical software 
                                        engineering procedure to Castlepoint and defined Castlepoint's trustworthy AI principles. In addition, I created trustworthy AI policy and procedure in 
                                        collaboration with Castlepoint's CEO to operationalize these defined values. Afterwards, I implemented some of the recommendations – on transparency, informed 
                                        consent and data privacy policy using the ethical software engineering procedure I proposed to Castlepoint.  
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="mb-0 text-black-50 text-lg-left">
                                        Before implementing the recommendations, the findings of the system analysis were reviewed to identify which of them can be implemented into Castlepoint software. 
                                        Need, Goal, and Objectives (NGO) was performed on the recommendations to evaluate and communicate their need, goal, and objectives to the Castlepoint staff, in 
                                        combination with a feasibility study to help identify which of the recommendations are feasible given the available skills, time, and resources, and to assess the 
                                        prerequisites for implementing them. Afterwards, I condcuted requirement discovery, classification, and organization, followed by , requirements prioritization and 
                                        negotiation, and then, requirements specification. Then, the system’s (prototype's) components and their relationships were defined, the system’s architectural 
                                        design, database schema, UI design, and algorithm and system models were created as abstractions of the system based on the specified requirements. The specified 
                                        systems requirements, algorithms and designs were implemented in Vue Js to create the prototype app. The prototype was written in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, 
                                        and Vue.js. I used vue-router for the frontend, and used Node Js, json-server, and Axios for the backend. The prototype application was demoed to the Castlepoint 
                                        staff to demonstrate how the recommendations on consent and transparent privacy policy may be implemented in Castlepoint, and to facilitate discussions about its 
                                        relevance and the concerns, questions and system requirements implementing it in Castlepoint raises.

                                        The Aviary is a virtual sound experience that replays the sounds of birds as they were captured on cameras in deployed parks - basically, a 
                                        park sounds time machine. It was created as part of a collaborative project at the 3A Institute, we wanted to create a cyber-physical system 
                                        that would serve as an artwork, while aiding and documenting in the recovery efforts of national parks in and around Canberra, including Namadgi 
                                        and Mulligan’s Flat. The Aviary is a system of 2 sub-systems, the Machine Learning Birds Classifier, Sorter and Logging System and the Aviary Sound 
                                        Capsule and Calendar interface.

                                        The <a href="https://aviary-app.herokuapp.com/">calendar interface</a> enables users to click on any date and hear the sound of birds replayed at the 
                                        precise time those birds were spotted by cameras. I built the interface with Node Js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript. The machine learning sub-system automatically 
                                        take the captured images from the park camera as input, uses computer vision model to recognize and classify the images by the bird names, and sorts the 
                                        high-risk and most-common birds into folders, while separating unidentifiable birds from pictures where no birds are present. It also automatically logs 
                                        the image capture timestamp and meta-data in a MongoDB database from which the calendar interface fetches the information about the birds that was captured 
                                        at the date and time the user has chosen from the interface to listen to. I developed the Birds Classifier, Sorter, and Logging system was developed with Python,
                                        Raspberry Pi, and MongoDB. To train the Birds Classfier model, I did transfer learning on a Google Coral Edge TPU and TensorFlow lite <a href="https://github.com/

                                        The Nigeria’s National Youth Service Corps is a one-year national service scheme where graduates are matched to jobs and 
                                        states within the country. The scheme records a very low performance in matching graduates to both states and zones, hence these graduates rematch 
                                        themselves using incentives, making the system unstable. I worked with mechanism design researchers in Nigeria and the United States of America (U.S.A) 
                                        to build a fair and stable matching mechanism for the scheme. We conducted interviews, a survey, survey data analysis, problem modeling, etc. I presented 
                                        the research at the mechanism design for social good workshop in ACM Conference on Economics and Computation, 2019 and at the ACM Compass, 2019.

                                        In this project, I conducted a survey, literature review and interviews to determine the factors responsible for the reduced interests of non-computer science students in 
                                        programming in Nigerian tertiary institutions.  I reviewed the various approaches used in teaching programming, and developed a web platform teaching system that teach programming skills like 
                                        skills, computational thinking, algorithms’ design, programming in general and Python programming specifically to students. The platform, named CodeEazee, is a problem solving, self-teaching tool 
                                        focused on teaching learning programming rather than programming languages. It uses templates and gamification, and embeds a 3rd party python interpreter to support offline programming learning.
                                        I developed CodeEazee as a final year project using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, PHP, JavaScript, jQuery, MySQL, Git, IPython.
