                                        In the episode, we explored the use of facial recognition for home-based quarantine during the pandemic, and how facial recognition may transition after the pandemic
                                        using the Multi-Level Perspective as an analytical framework. We present our interview of diverse experts including Lizzie O'Shea, founder of Digital Rights Watch;

                                    <p class="mb-0 text-black-50 text-lg-left">
                                        During my master's at the 3AInstitute, I interned at Castlepoint Systems as an AI Ethics Intern where I was tasked to help develop
                                        a Trustworthy AI framework for the scaling of Castlepoint Systems globally. To develop the trustworthy AI framework, I conducted a
                                        system analysis then, prototyped some of the system analysis results. The system analysis involved of an analysis of Castlepoint’s culture, policies, and work practices, surveyed trustworthy AI and 
                                        ethical AI frameworks using document analysis of published trustworthy and ethical AI principles, then I conducted interviews, and 
                                        ethnographic research at Castlepoint. I did a case study on the implications of AI systems at scale, and then, conducted Castlepoint
                                        Systems stakeholder analysis and values elicitation by conducting a judgment call workshop with Castlepoint employees from a Value 
                                        Sensitive Design approach. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="mb-0 text-black-50 text-lg-left">
                                        The findings of the system analysis were reviewed to identify which of them can be implemented into Castlepoint software. Need, Goal, 
                                        and Objectives (NGO) was performed on the recommendations to evaluate and communicate their need, goal, and objectives to the Castlepoint
                                        staff, in combination with a feasibility study to help identify which of the recommendations are feasible given the available skills, time, 
                                        and resources, and to evaluate the prerequisites for implementing them. Afterwards, I condcuted requirement discovery, classification, and 
                                        organization, prioritization and negotiation, and then, requirements specification. Then, the system’s components and their relationships 
                                        were defined, the system’s architectural design, database schema, UI design, and algorithm and system models were created as abstractions of 
                                        the system based on the specified requirements. The specified systems requirements, algorithms and designs were implemented in to create a prototype app. 
                                        The prototype was built on Vue.js, vue-router for the frontend, node, json-server, and axios for the backend. It is written in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, 
                                        jQuery, and Vue.js. The prototype application was demoed to the Castlepoint staff to demonstrate how the recommendations on consent and transparent privacy 
                                        policy may be implemented in Castlepoint, and to facilitate discussions about its relevance and the concerns, questions and system requirements implementing 
                                        it in Castlepoint raises.

                                    <p class="mb-0 text-black-50 text-lg-left">The Aviary is a virtual sound experience that could replays the sounds of birds as they were captured on cameras 
                                        in deployed parks - basically a park sounds time machine. It was created as part of a collaborative project at the 3A Institute, we wanted 
                                        to create a cyber-physical system that would serve as an artwork, while aiding and documenting in the recovery efforts of national parks in 
                                        and around Canberra, including Namadgi and Mulligan’s Flat. The Avairy is a system of 2 sub-systems, the Machine Learning Birds Classifier, Sorter and Logging System and the Aviary Sound 
                                        Capstule and calendar interface. The <a href="https://aviary-app.herokuapp.com/">calendar interface</a> enables users to click on any date 
                                        and hear the sound of birds replayed at the precise time those birds were spotted by cameras. The interface was built with node js, HTML, 
                                        CSS, Javascript. While the machine learning sub-system automatically take the captured images from the park camera as input, uses computer 
                                        vision model to recognize and classify the images by the bird names, and sorts the high-risk and most-common birds into folders, while separating 
                                        unidentifiable birds from pictures where no birds are present. It also automatically log the image capture timestamp and meta-data in a MongoDB 
                                        database from which the calendar interface fetch the information about the birds that was captured at the date and time the user has chosen from 
                                        the interface to listen to. The Birds classifier, sorted and logging system was developed in Python and MongoDB. I used a Tensorflowlite model, more details are provided <a href="https://github.com/4A-Team/AviaryApp">here</a>.</br>

                                    <p class="mb-0 text-black-50">The Nigeria’s National Youth Service Corps is a one-year national service scheme where graduates are matched to jobs and 
                                        states within the country. The scheme records a very low performance in matching graduates to both states and zones, hence these graduates rematch 
                                        themselves using incentives, making the system unstable. I am working with mechanism design researchers in Nigeria and the United States of America 
                                        to build a fair and stable matching mechanism for the scheme. I presented the research at the mechanism design for social good workshop in ACM Conference 
                                        on Economics and Computation, 2019 and at the ACM Compass, 2019.</p>
